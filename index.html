        <h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
             <P>Voting for general and local elections is done by electors with voting papers and 
                ng boxes in which the voting papers are placed.<br> This method reveals some kinds of
                tive situations. Not being able to determine which party the stamp belongs to, the
                robability of placing the voting papers in the wrong box, problems with counting the votes,
                of time when there happens to be some objections, paper printing and expenditures done
                personal use are some of the disadvantages of the classical election system.<br>The secret
                ot is a fundamental instrument for protecting the freedom of choice of voters. For this
                son, it is necessary to use new technologies to make the election system more trustable,
                onomical and faster.</p><br><p>The elections that are made by using traditional methods are no longer
                rred because of the long period of preparation, fake voting, faulty voting, mistakes made
                ounting the votes, long period of counting and high cost of voting process.<br>In order to
                void these disadvantages affecting directly the economy and policy of the country, it is
                gatory to carry the available voting system through a website. In this study, a website, EVoting
        
                for a general election is developed, Face and Fingerprint authentication based eng
        
                system is applied. As a result, security of the voting system is greatly improved by
                a biometric authentication system.</P><br><br>

                <p><i>A direct-recording electronic (DRE) voting machine records votes by means of a 
                ballot display provided with mechanical or electro-optical components that can be activated
                by the voter (typically buttons or a touchscreen); that processes data with computer software;
                and that records voting data and ballot images in memory components. After the election it
                produces a tabulation of the voting data stored in a removable memory component and as a
                printed copy.</i> <em>The system may also provide a means for transmitting individual ballots or vote
                totals to a central location for consolidating and reporting results from precincts at the central
                location.</em> <i>These systems use a precinct count method that tabulates ballots at the polling
                place. They typically tabulate ballots as they are cast and print the results after the close of
                polling. Electronic voting in the United States involves several types of machines: touch
                screens for voters to mark choices, scanners to read paper ballots, scanners to verify
                signatures on envelopes of absentee ballots, and web servers to display tallies to the public.<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_voting_in_India">This link show more details about voting system of india</a>
